# CruiseControl
Maturaprojekt 2018/19 by Benjamin Egger and Tomas Neuner

The goal of this project is to create an artifical intelligence based on neuroevolution, a specialised machine learning algorithm which orients itself on natures evolution process.

The project is based on the [NEAT paper](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) published by MIT and implemented with help of the [NEAT-Python](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python) framework
